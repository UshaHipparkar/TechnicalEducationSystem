            <h1>Javascript:</h1>
            <h2>Welcome to the MDN beginner's JavaScript course! In this article we will look at JavaScript from a high
                level, answering questions such as "What is it?" and "What can you do with it?", and making sure you are
                comfortable with JavaScript's purpose.
                JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web
                pages every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to
                look at displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video
                jukeboxes, etc.you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer
                cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in
                other parts of the Learning Area.
