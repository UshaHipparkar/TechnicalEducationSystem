        <h1>Web Designing:</h1>
        <h2>Although web design has a fairly recent history, it can be linked to other areas such as graphic design,
            user experience, and multimedia arts, but is more aptly seen from a technological standpoint. It has become
            a large part of people's everyday lives. It is hard to imagine the Internet without animated graphics,
            different styles of typography, background, videos and music. In November 1992, Cern was the first website
            to ever launch to go live. The web was announced on August 6, 1991, and CERN was the first website to go
            live on the world wide web. During this period, websites were structured by using the <table> tag which
                created numbers on the website. Eventually, web designers were able to find their way around it to
                create more structures and format</h2>
